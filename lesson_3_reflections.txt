When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people, it is a good idea to use a remote repository. So that
others can view and add to our work by commiting their own changes. So basically, 
using a remote repository is a great way to collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We might not want to pull all the commits done by all the different contributors. This 
would not have been possible if GitHub allowed automatic pull. Manual pulling enable us
to pull only that branch that include our desirable features or contents.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

Branches are used within a repository to make changes without affecting the main/master
branch.
Clones are used to copy one repository from a remote to local computer or from the local
computer to another location within the computer to make our own changes to the project.
Fork is used to someone's repository from their GitHub account to our own GitHub account.
This helps us to use their project and make our own commits to it without affecting their
copy of the project.
