When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people, it is a good idea to use a remote repository. So that
others can view and add to our work by commiting their own changes. So basically, 
using a remote repository is a great way to collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

We might not want to pull all the commits done by all the different contributors. This 
would not have been possible if GitHub allowed automatic pull. Manual pulling enable us
to pull only that branch that include our desirable features or contents.
